# Blog Writing Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

**Grounded, not hype**
- Avoid "cheesy weird or ai heavy" language
- No excessive validation or superlatives ("amazing", "incredible", "game-changing")
- Skip corporate phrases like "division of labor"
- Write like you talk - direct and practical

**Natural flow**
- Avoid choppy short sentences (2-3 words)
- Combine related ideas into flowing prose
- Use proper connectors between thoughts
- Read like a conversation, not bullet points

## Structure and Narrative

**Lead with concrete moments**
- Start with a specific situation or problem
- Don't open with generic statements like "I've been using X for a year"
- Make the problem visceral before introducing the solution

**Follow engineering blog patterns**
- Study: Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Dan Luu, Julia Evans
- Tell a story with smooth transitions
- Lead with examples, derive principles from them
- Mix anecdote and insight naturally
- Use section headers to guide, not fragment

**Integrate examples**
- Weave examples into the narrative
- Avoid awkward phrases like "Concrete example:"
- Don't separate as distinct sections unless necessary
- Examples should feel like part of the story

## Content Guidelines

**Be accurate**
- Don't fabricate specific conversations that didn't happen
- Use realistic examples you can actually verify
- If something is general/pattern-based, frame it that way
- Check facts (e.g., "Alpha Arena is ongoing", not "DeepSeek won")

**Show, don't brag**
- Project stats are fine when they demonstrate value
- Focus on HOW context/structure enabled results
- Not: "Built X in 3 weeks, Y requests/sec"
- Better: "This timeline was possible because [context enabled fast iteration]"

**Avoid lists where prose works**
- "Patterns That Work" as 4 mini-sections = fragmented
- Better: Integrate into narrative flow
- Lists are fine for code/structure, not for concepts

## Specific Patterns to Avoid

- Sentence fragments as standalone paragraphs
- "This is the problem..." overly dramatic framing
- Starting paragraphs with "Concrete example:"
- Lists of project achievements without context
- Phrases like "The shift makes sense:"
- Corporate language ("division of labor", "value proposition")

## What Works

- Opening with a specific problem moment
- Building the case naturally through examples
- Concrete timelines that demonstrate value (e.g., "1 day to get trading, 1 week to stable")
- Explaining HOW something works, not just WHAT it does
- Practical "copy this prompt" sections over abstract theory
- Closing with insight, not summary

## Editing Process

1. **First pass**: Write the story/narrative
2. **Second pass**: Remove choppy sentences, combine related ideas
3. **Third pass**: Cut hype language and extraneous details
4. **Fourth pass**: Verify accuracy of all claims
5. **Final pass**: Read aloud - does it sound natural?

## Examples of Good vs Bad

**Bad opening:**
> I've been using AI coding tools for over a year. Built several projects. All with Claude Code.

**Better opening:**
> Working with Claude on multi-week projects, I kept hitting the same problem: every new conversation started from zero.

**Bad transition:**
> Concrete example: Pacabot took one day...

**Better:**
> Pacabot, a trading bot using DeepSeek, took one day to get making trading decisions from market data.

**Bad closing:**
> That division of labor - Claude handling the context maintenance, me handling the architectural decisions and verification - is what makes building substantial projects with AI agents practical.

**Better:**
> Claude maintains its own context as it works. I maintain direction and judgment. This split - Claude handling documentation, me handling decisions and verification - is what makes it work.
