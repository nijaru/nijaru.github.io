Everyone's using AI wrong.

They let it write code while they watch. They're building nothing and learning less.

## The Seductive Trap

Claude Code impressed me. Tell it what you want, it modifies your files. Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini - they all promise the same thing: code faster by coding less.

It works. For trivial tasks.

But watch what happens to your brain.

## The Context Problem

When AI writes code, you lose context. Not the AI's context - yours.

You stop understanding your codebase. You stop learning patterns. You stop growing as a developer.

You spend all your time giving the AI context. You never build your own.

## My Workflow

I use Zed with Claude. I add files to context manually. The AI suggests code. I type it myself.

Yes, it's slower. That's the point.

By typing the code, I understand every line, spot potential issues, learn new patterns, and maintain my mental model.

The AI guides. I build.

## The Real Value

AI is incredible at explaining unfamiliar code, suggesting approaches, finding edge cases, and remembering syntax.

Use it for those things.

Don't use it to avoid thinking.

## Speed vs Understanding

"But I ship 10x faster with AI writing my code!"

Cool. Do you understand what you shipped?

Can you debug it when it breaks?
Can you extend it next month?
Can you explain it to your team?

Speed without understanding is technical debt with compound interest.

## The Middle Path

I'm not saying abandon AI tools. I use them daily.

But there's a difference between AI writing while you watch, and AI suggesting while you implement.

One makes you faster today. The other makes you better forever.

## For Complex Work

Simple CRUD endpoint? Let AI write it.

Complex business logic? Don't vibe code it away.

The more complex the problem, the more valuable manual implementation becomes. You need to understand the nuances, the trade-offs, the why behind every decision.

AI can't give you that understanding. Only building can.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most developers using AI are getting worse at coding.

They're faster at producing code they don't understand. They're building features they can't debug. They're shipping products they can't maintain.

Building things yourself with AI guidance is infinitely more valuable than guiding AI to build things for you.

Choose wisely.
