AI writes code faster than I can. Not just a little faster - dramatically faster. Claude Code can scaffold entire features, refactor complex systems, and implement APIs in minutes instead of hours.

This velocity enables building substantial projects in weeks instead of months. The speed is real, the possibilities are significant.

But there's a tradeoff I've noticed: I feel less present in what's actually happening.

## Being There

When Claude writes the code directly, I'm reviewing instead of building. I read through the changes, verify they look right, run tests, merge. It works. The code ships. The features function.

But I don't have the same mental model I'd have if I'd written it myself. The edge cases aren't as obvious. The design decisions aren't as internalized. When something breaks, I have to rebuild context about code I approved but didn't write.

This isn't necessarily bad. It's just different. Like the difference between driving somewhere and being a passenger - you get to the same destination, but your sense of the route differs.

## When It Matters

For straightforward implementation - API endpoints, database models, test boilerplate - presence doesn't matter much. The patterns are standard. The tradeoffs are well-understood. Let AI handle it.

For complex logic or novel approaches, presence becomes significant. When I'm implementing something new or solving a non-standard problem, I want to be in the details. Not because typing is inherently better, but because that's where understanding develops.

I've started using AI differently based on complexity. Simple tasks: let it write. Complex problems: have it suggest approaches and generate pieces, but I write the core logic myself. Not for purity, but because I need to understand what I'm building.

## The Actual Tradeoff

The honest assessment: AI-generated code means I ship more but understand less of what I ship. For some projects, that's fine. For others, it's a problem.

When I need to debug something deep in the system, the lack of presence shows. When I need to extend functionality in unexpected ways, it matters. When I'm trying to optimize performance, it becomes friction.

This is the real exchange. Incredible speed and possibility, but you're further from the implementation. You can move faster than ever, but you're navigating with less detailed maps.

I don't think this means we should avoid AI code generation. The capabilities are too valuable. But it does mean being deliberate about when to let AI write versus when to write yourself.

Presence is the price of velocity. Sometimes it's worth paying. Sometimes it's not.
