## Thoughts on AI-Assisted Development

After working with Claude Code and other AI coding assistants, I've been reflecting on the impact these tools have on the development process and learning.

I did end up just editing parts of my previous post myself since I still can't convince the AI to not write like an AI. Still, I was able to coax it into generating some jokes that were almost funny.

Letting AI completely take the reins is useful for trivial tasks. For everything else, you lose so much gained knowledge. The tradeoff for increased velocity is significant, though worthwhile in some cases.

Still, it is quite impressive how far you can get with just enough domain knowledge to steer it in the right direction.

I'm currently looking for new engineering opportunities! If you're hiring someone who loves building backends, dealing with databases, applying AI, and has strong Python or Go skills, I'd love to chat!
