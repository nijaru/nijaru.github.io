## Thoughts on AI-Assisted Development

I wanted to write a follow-up to my previous post. I assume it was readily apparent throughout that it was AI-generated. After spending some time using Claude Code and other AI coding tools, I've been reflecting on how they impact both my development workflow and the learning process.

I used *Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking* to write the blog post itself. It certainly did a *job*. It covered everything about my site upgrade, working with Claude Code, and a bit about me. I'm sure I could've worked it into something better with more prompting. I was able to coax it into generating some jokes that were almost funny. It wasn't bad, but there is something about AI-generated prose that doesn't sound quite right. The tone just feels a little off. I did end up editing parts of my previous post since I couldn't convince the AI not to write like an AI.

As for Claude Code, I didn't have high initial expectations, but I was quite impressed with it. Most of the site update was very straightforward. I would tell it what I wanted for the site, and it would create or modify files as needed. There was the occasional request that needed some extra prompting or workaround to fix, but it was able to complete most requests without any issues.

Most of my LLM coding usage has been with Zed. You add relevant files to context manually and work with the LLM in the assistant panel. You can have it automatically edit highlighted lines as well, but I tend to avoid that and just edit the code myself. I like this workflow because I can quickly give it the required context, review the output, make any corrections, then apply the changes.

By editing the code myself, I keep my own mental context up to date. Claude Code, aider, and similar tools drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to code, but you lose a lot of personal context. I haven't spent a lot of time with automated tools like these because I have preferred a manual approach, and I still think editing code yourself has a lot of value.

Letting AI completely take the reins is useful for trivial tasks. For everything else, you lose so much gained knowledge. The trade-off for increased velocity is significant, though it can be worthwhile in some cases.

**For anything complex, building things yourself with guidance from AI is infinitely more valuable than guiding AI to build things for you.**

Still, it is quite impressive how far you can get with just enough domain knowledge to steer it in the right direction.

In case you couldn't tell, this post was 100% all-organic homegrown and handwritten.
