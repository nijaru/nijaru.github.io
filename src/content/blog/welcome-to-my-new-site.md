I've been wanting to rewrite my website and start learning a new frontend framework, and with the recent release of Claude Code, I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity. The result is a complete rebuild using Solid.js and Astro with a space theme.

## Why the Change?

My previous site was built with Hugo, which served me well for quite some time. Hugo is great for static sites, and I had no real complaints about it. I've been keeping tabs on newer frameworks, though, and this rebuild gave me the perfect excuse to finally get my hands dirty with them.

For the design, I went with a space theme - dark background with lime green accents. I thought it would look cool and wanted to see if Claude could implement it. This was a good test case for the AI pair programming tool while giving my site a fresh look. Let me break down the tech stack I used.

## Technical Implementation

I built the new site with this combination of tools:

- <span class="text-accent-blue">Solid.js</span> for reactive components and interactions
- <span class="text-accent-purple">Astro</span> for static site generation and performance
- <span class="text-lime-400">Tailwind CSS</span> for styling

This setup gives me the speed and responsiveness I wanted, plus it's been fun to work with. Solid.js handles the interactive elements with its reactive system, while Astro takes care of generating optimized static pages. I'm still getting up to speed with Solid.js, but I'm already finding it more intuitive than React for my needs.

## Working with Claude Code

What made this rebuild interesting was using Claude Code as an AI pair programmer. It helped me iterate much more quickly than I might have otherwise. I was surprised by how well it understood what I was trying to accomplish, especially with the visual elements of the space theme.

In the past, I've used LLMs mainly to look up documentation and help design the architecture of my apps, but rarely for writing actual code. Claude Code flips this pattern - I can describe what I want built, and it handles the implementation details. It's a different workflow that's proven surprisingly effective for certain tasks.

## What I'm Up To

These days I'm busy coding on new projects and researching ways to apply AI to development workflows. I'm not in founder mode right now - I'm in <span class="text-lime-300 font-medium">Flounder modeâ„¢.</span> It's a productive chaos that often leads to unexpected insights.

Sometimes it helps me create connections between ideas I never would have seen otherwise. Every abandoned project teaches me something, even if that something is just <span class="italic text-gray-100">"maybe I should think twice before trying to rewrite Redis in Go at 2 AM on a Tuesday."</span>

I pivot so often my LinkedIn profile has <strong class="text-lime-300">motion sickness</strong>. One day I'm building a distributed database, the next I'm convinced I need to create yet another JavaScript framework. My version control history is a metaphor for my dating life - <span class="bg-lime-500/10 px-1">hundreds of commits but afraid of the final merge</span>. I tell myself <em class="text-gray-100">"this is totally normal product exploration"</em> while my git log reads like a crime scene investigation.

## What's Next?

I plan to use this blog to share thoughts on:

- Backend development insights
- Computer science topics, distributed systems, and databases
- Learning new programming languages like Mojo, Rust, and Zig
- Updates on projects like yt-text and others

Thanks for stopping by. If you want to connect, you can find me on GitHub, X, Bluesky, or LinkedIn.

And yes, of course I wrote this post with AI - I just served as the editor. Seems fitting for a post about working with Claude Code, doesn't it?

I'm currently looking for new engineering opportunities! If you're hiring someone who loves building backends, dealing with databases, applying AI, and has strong Python or Go skills, I'd love to chat!
