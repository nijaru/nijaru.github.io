I unlock my phone by looking at it. I don't think about Face ID, it just happens. Spotify plays music I'll probably like without me searching. My car maintains speed without constant input.

These interfaces disappeared. They work without demanding attention.

Current AI interfaces haven't disappeared yet. They're very present. Chat windows, prompts, explicit commands. You tell the AI what you want, wait for response, correct misunderstandings, repeat.

This might be where we stay. Or it might be temporary.

## What Disappearing Looks Like

Interfaces tend to simplify over time. Command-line required memorizing syntax. Graphical interfaces replaced that with visual recognition. Touch simplified further - direct manipulation instead of cursor control. Voice simplified again - speak naturally instead of learning gestures.

The pattern isn't toward zero interface. It's toward interfaces that adapt to you instead of requiring you to adapt to them.

Current AI requires adaptation. You learn to write good prompts. You develop patterns for getting useful responses. You adjust your communication style to work with how AI understands things.

Future AI might invert this. It learns your patterns instead of you learning its limitations. It understands context from how you work, not from explicit explanation. It anticipates needs based on what it's seen you do before.

This only works with persistent memory. An AI that doesn't remember yesterday can't learn your patterns. It needs repeated context every session. That's why current AI requires such explicit interfaces - it doesn't know you.

## The Technical Reality

We're building toward more anticipatory systems. Code completion evolved from simple keyword matching to understanding broader context. Search evolved from keyword matching to understanding intent. Recommendations evolved from simple correlation to modeling preferences.

The technical pieces for anticipatory AI exist: memory systems that retain context, models that understand intent, systems that predict actions. We just haven't connected them in ways that feel natural yet.

This isn't about removing all interaction. It's about removing unnecessary friction. You still make decisions, you just don't have to explain the same context repeatedly. You still direct the work, the AI just understands what you're trying to do.

## Where This Goes

Interfaces might not fully disappear. Maybe we'll always need some explicit control. But they'll probably become less demanding of attention.

Your IDE might notice you're refactoring similar patterns and offer to complete the rest. Your system might pull up relevant documentation when you hit a problem without being asked. Your tools might adapt to how you work instead of requiring you to learn their specific interaction model.

None of this requires brain-computer interfaces or science fiction technology. It just requires AI that remembers your patterns and understands your context.

The question isn't whether interfaces can disappear entirely. It's how much friction we can remove while maintaining useful control.

Current AI is explicit: you tell it exactly what you want. Future AI might be implicit: it understands from context what you're trying to do.

That's the actual shift. Not removing interfaces, but making them require less conscious attention.
