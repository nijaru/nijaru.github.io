          I've been wanting to rewrite my website and start learning a new frontend framework, and with the recent release of Claude Code, I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity. The result is a complete rebuild using Solid.js and Astro with a space theme.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          My previous site was built with Hugo, which served me well for quite some time. Hugo is great for static sites, and I had no real complaints about it. I've been keeping tabs on newer frameworks, though, and this rebuild gave me the perfect excuse to finally get my hands dirty with them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          For the design, I went with a space theme - dark background with lime green accents. I thought it would look cool and wanted to see if Claude could implement it. This was a good test case for the AI pair programming tool while giving my site a fresh look. Let me break down the tech stack I used.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          I built the new site with this combination of tools:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 space-y-2 my-4 ml-4">
          <li><span class="text-accent-blue">Solid.js</span> for reactive components and interactions</li>
          <li><span class="text-accent-purple">Astro</span> for static site generation and performance</li>
          <li><span class="text-lime-400">Tailwind CSS</span> for styling</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          This setup gives me the speed and responsiveness I wanted, plus it's been fun to work with. Solid.js handles the interactive elements with its reactive system, while Astro takes care of generating optimized static pages. I'm still getting up to speed with Solid.js, but I'm already finding it more intuitive than React for my needs.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          What made this rebuild interesting was using Claude Code as an AI pair programmer. It helped me iterate much more quickly than I might have otherwise. I was surprised by how well it understood what I was trying to accomplish, especially with the visual elements of the space theme.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          In the past, I've used LLMs mainly to look up documentation and help design the architecture of my apps, but rarely for writing actual code. Claude Code flips this pattern - I can describe what I want built, and it handles the implementation details. It's a different workflow that's proven surprisingly effective for certain tasks.

          These days I'm busy coding on new projects and researching ways to apply AI to development workflows. I'm not in founder mode right now - I'm in what I call "flounder mode." It's when you bounce between different project ideas, trying things out to see what sticks. You explore concepts without committing fully to any single path. It's a productive kind of chaos that often leads to unexpected insights.

          And yes, of course I wrote this post with AI - I just served as the editor. Seems fitting for a post about working with Claude Code, doesn't it?
