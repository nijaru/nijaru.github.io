                    I've been wanting to rewrite my website and start learning a new
                    frontend framework, and with the recent release of Claude Code, I
                    thought it'd be the perfect opportunity. The result is a complete
                    rebuild using Solid.js and Astro with a space theme.

                <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    My previous site was built with Hugo, which served me well for quite
                    some time. Hugo is great for static sites, and I had no real
                    complaints about it. I've been keeping tabs on newer frameworks,
                    though, and this rebuild gave me the perfect excuse to finally get
                    my hands dirty with them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    For the design, I went with a space theme - dark background with
                    lime green accents. I thought it would look cool and wanted to see
                    if Claude could implement it. This was a good test case for the AI
                    pair programming tool while giving my site a fresh look. Let me
                    break down the tech stack I used.

                <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    I built the new site with this combination of tools:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 space-y-2 mb-4 ml-4">
                    <li>
                        <span class="text-accent-blue">Solid.js</span> for reactive components
                        and interactions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="text-accent-purple">Astro</span> for static site generation
                        and performance
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="text-lime-400">Tailwind CSS</span> for styling</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This setup gives me the speed and responsiveness I wanted, plus it's
                    been fun to work with. Solid.js handles the interactive elements
                    with its reactive system, while Astro takes care of generating
                    optimized static pages. I'm still getting up to speed with Solid.js,
                    but I'm already finding it more intuitive than React for my needs.

                    What made this rebuild interesting was using Claude Code as an AI
                    pair programmer. It helped me iterate much more quickly than I might
                    have otherwise. I was surprised by how well it understood what I was
                    trying to accomplish, especially with the visual elements of the
                    space theme.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In the past, I've used LLMs mainly to look up documentation and help
                    design the architecture of my apps, but rarely for writing actual
                    code. Claude Code flips this pattern - I can describe what I want
                    built, and it handles the implementation details. It's a different
                    workflow that's proven surprisingly effective for certain tasks.
