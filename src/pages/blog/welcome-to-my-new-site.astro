          So I finally did it. After sitting on this idea for months, I've completely rebuilt my personal site using Solid.js and Astro. The space theme has been living in my head for a while now, and I'm glad I finally brought it to life.

        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          My previous site was built with Hugo, which served me well for quite some time. Hugo is great for static sites, and I had no real complaints about it. But I've been wanting to try something new, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to experiment with some different technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The space theme with its dark background and lime green accents feels more like me. It better represents both my technical interests and personal aesthetic. Plus, I just really like how it looks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          What made this rebuild particularly interesting was that I did most of it with Claude Code. Having an AI pair programmer helped me work through challenges and iterate more quickly than I might have otherwise. It was a good learning experience to see how AI tools can fit into my workflow.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          The site is built with a few key technologies:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 space-y-2 my-4 ml-4">
          <li><span class="text-accent-blue">Solid.js</span> for reactive components and interactions</li>
          <li><span class="text-accent-purple">Astro</span> for static site generation and performance</li>
          <li><span class="text-lime-400">Tailwind CSS</span> for styling</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          This tech stack makes for a fast, responsive site that's also enjoyable to develop. The animations and interactive elements are powered by Solid.js's reactive system, while Astro handles the static generation for optimal performance. I'm still learning Solid.js, but so far I'm enjoying working with it more than React.

          These days I'm spending most of my time working on my backend-as-a-service platform. It's coming along nicely, though I regularly find myself in what I call "flounder mode" - that state where you know what you want to build but you're not entirely sure how to approach it, so you try a bunch of different things until something clicks. It's frustrating and productive at the same time, if that makes any sense.
