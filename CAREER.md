## Target Roles

| Priority | Role                    | Companies                     | Fit                       |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | Infrastructure Engineer | Anthropic, OpenAI, Scale      | High - Rust + systems     |
| 2        | Platform Engineer       | Databricks, Snowflake, Vercel | High - DB + infra         |
| 3        | Systems Engineer        | Discord, Cloudflare, Figma    | High - Rust + performance |
| 4        | ML Platform/MLOps       | Any AI company                | Medium - need ML basics   |
| 5        | Backend Engineer        | Startups, mid-size            | Fallback - overqualified  |

## Current Strengths

**Strong:**

- Rust (production-level: OmenDB, SeerDB, jb, pacabun)
- Systems programming (SIMD, lock-free, performance optimization)
- Database internals (HNSW, LSM, B-trees, learned indexes)
- Python (FastAPI, testing, PyO3 bindings)
- Shipping production code (open source, documented, tested)

**Adequate:**

- Go, C/C++
- Docker, Linux administration
- AWS/GCP basics
- gRPC, REST APIs

**Gaps to Address:**

- System design interviews
- ML fundamentals
- Distributed systems depth
- Leetcode (rusty)

## Study Plan

### Phase 1: System Design (2-3 weeks)

- [ ] DDIA - Chapters 1-9 (core concepts)
- [ ] System design primer (GitHub) - review patterns
- [ ] Practice: Design a vector database, design a distributed cache

### Phase 2: Interview Prep (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Neetcode 150 - focus on patterns, not memorization
- [ ] Behavioral stories - STAR format for Omnitier, OmenDB, hackathon

### Phase 3: ML Basics (ongoing, lower priority)

- [ ] fast.ai practical deep learning
- [ ] Hugging Face transformers basics
- [ ] Fine-tune a small model

## Interview Prep Notes

### System Design Topics to Master

- [ ] Distributed databases (sharding, replication, consensus)
- [ ] Caching systems (Redis, Memcached patterns)
- [ ] Message queues (Kafka, pub/sub)
- [ ] Search systems (inverted index, ranking)
- [ ] Vector search (HNSW - you know this!)
- [ ] Rate limiting, load balancing

### Behavioral Stories

1. **Omnitier test optimization** - 90% reduction, syscall analysis
2. **OmenDB architecture** - design decisions, tradeoffs, solo shipping
3. **Hackathon win** - team leadership, rapid prototyping
4. **Self-taught journey** - motivation, learning approach

## Networking

- [ ] Update LinkedIn
- [ ] Reach out to 42 network
- [ ] Dev Bootcamp alumni
- [ ] Open source communities (Rust, vector DB space)
