I attended a Kubernetes workshop given by [Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanj) from [CoreOS](http://coreos.com/) in SF on May 30th. I want to give a huge shoutout to Ryan for all the work he put into the slides and presentation. I wanted to share the material from the [slides](bit.ly/k8s-fest) with others and make it a little easier to follow along on your own.

I will be working on a series of posts covering what I know about containers, kubernetes, distributed systems, and how to use these tools. I will provide links and resources as well. The first few are going to cover the material from Ryan's presentation and further ones will expand on these topics. If you have any feedback, please reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nijaruuu)
