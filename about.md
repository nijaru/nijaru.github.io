title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, containers, networking, and security. I have used Go, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, and C++. I am also learning Rust and a little Clojure.

I use MacOS on a hackintosh along with Debian, Fedora, or Solus. I typically use Ubuntu on servers. I also have some experience with Container Linux, Alpine Linux, and VyOS. My current projects include using Go for web and networking projects, learning Rust, and diving into Linux internals.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
