title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, Linux, containers, and security. I use Go and Python to get things doneâ„¢. I also know Javascript, Ruby, and a little C++.

I am interested in Rust, Elixir, Elm, and Haskell. I use MacOS on my laptop and hackintosh along with Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers. I also have some experience with Fedora, Container Linux, and Alpine Linux.

My current projects include building a websocket chat app with go, working with Linux, and contributing to open source projects. I have been learning Kubernetes and working on security projects as well.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
