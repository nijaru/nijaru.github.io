title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, containers, security, and networking. I use Go and Python to get things doneâ„¢. I know Ruby, Javascript, and C++ as well.

I am also learning Rust and Clojure. I use MacOS on my laptop and hackintosh along with Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers. I have some experience with Fedora, Container Linux, Alpine Linux, and VyOS.

My current projects include using go for networking, working with Linux, and contributing to open source. I have been learning about Kubernetes and security as well.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
