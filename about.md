title: About
---

I am a software developer from California who likes web development, linux,
containers, and distributed systems. I use Go and Python to get things doneâ„¢. I
also know Javascript, Ruby, and a little C++. I am interested in Rust and
Haskell as well. I use MacOS on my laptop and hackintosh, although I also use
Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers. I have some experience with Fedora,
Container linux, and Alpine as well.

My current projects include building web apps with go and javascript, working
with kubernetes, and contributing to open source projects. I am interested in
building an interpreter, a kernel, a proxy server, and a simple key-value store.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
