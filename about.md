title: About
---

I am a software developer from California who likes web development, linux,
containers, and distributed systems. I use Go and Python to get things doneâ„¢. I
also know Javascript, Ruby, and a little C++.

I am interested in Rust, Elixir,
and Haskell as well. I use MacOS on my laptop and hackintosh, although I use
Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers too. I also have some experience with Fedora,
Container linux, and Alpine linux.

My current projects include building web apps with Go and Javascript, working
with Kubernetes, building an interpreter, and contributing to open source projects. I am interested in
building a kernel, a proxy server, and a simple key-value store.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
