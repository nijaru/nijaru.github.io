title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in linux, networking, security, and distributed systems. I have used Go, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, and C++. I am also learning Rust and a little Clojure.

I primarily use Fedora, but I have also used Debian, Ubuntu, and MacOS for development. I have some experience with Gentoo, Container Linux, Alpine, and VyOS. My current projects include using Rust and Go for system and networking projects and diving into Linux internals.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
