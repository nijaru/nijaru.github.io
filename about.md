title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in distributed systems, networking, and security. I have used Go, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, and C++. I am also learning Rust and a little Clojure.

I use MacOS on a hackintosh, Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora. I also have some experience with Gentoo, Container Linux, Alpine, and VyOS. My current projects include using Rust and Go for system and networking projects and diving into Linux internals.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
