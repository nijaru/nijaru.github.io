title: About
---

I am a software developer from California who likes web development, containers, and distributed systems. I mainly use Go to solve problems along with a little Javascript, Python, Ruby, C++, and Haskell.

My current projects include building web apps with Go and Javascript, working with Kubernetes, and contributing to open source projects. Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
