I am a software developer from California who likes web development, APIs, and infrastructure. I mainly use Go, Python, and Javascript to solve problems, along with a little Ruby and Haskell.

My current projects include working on web apps with Javascript, writing an interpreter, and contributing to open source projects such as golang/dep.
Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
