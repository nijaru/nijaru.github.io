title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in linux, networking, security, and distributed systems. I use Go, C, C++, Python, Ruby, and Javascript. I am learning Rust and have an interest in Haskell, Racket, and Clojure.

I primarily use Fedora, but I also have experience with Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows. I have some experience with Kali, Gentoo, Container Linux, Alpine, and VyOS. My current projects include using Rust and Go for CLI and networking projects and diving into security.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
