title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, linux,
containers, and security. I use Go and Python to get things doneâ„¢. I also know
Javascript, Ruby, and a little C++.

I am interested in Rust, Elixir, and Haskell as well. I use MacOS on my laptop
and hackintosh along with Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers. I also have
some experience with Fedora, Container linux, and Alpine linux.

My current projects include building web apps with Go and Javascript, working
with Kubernetes, building an interpreter, and contributing to open source
projects. I am interested in building a kernel, a proxy server, and a simple
key-value store.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
