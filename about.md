title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, containers, networking, and security. I have used Go, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, and C++. I am also learning Rust and Clojure.

I use MacOS on a hackintosh along with Debian and Solus. I use Linux for development and typically use Ubuntu on servers. I have some experience with Fedora, Container Linux, Alpine Linux, and VyOS as well. My current projects include using Go for web and networking, learning Rust, and diving into Linux internals.

(I currently use vim, but I am slowly repenting from my ways and learning emacs) ;)

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
