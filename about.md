title: About
---

I am a software developer from California interested in web development, Linux, containers, and security. I use Go and Python to get work doneâ„¢. I also know Ruby, Javascript, and some C++.

I am learning Rust, Elm, and Haskell as well. I use MacOS on my laptop and hackintosh along with Debian and Ubuntu at home and on servers. I have some experience with Fedora, Container Linux, and Alpine Linux.

My current projects include building web apps with Javascript, learning Linux internals, and contributing to open source. I have also been learning Kubernetes and working on security projects.

Outside of code, I like music production, photography, and hiking.
