# Blog Editor Guidelines

Standards for reviewing and writing blog posts.

## Voice

- First person, direct
- "I found" not "you should"
- Share what works, not prescriptions
- Acknowledge limitations honestly

## Structure

- **Opening:** Hook with the payoff or insight, not the problem setup
- **Headers:** Short, direct. "In practice" not "What this actually looks like"
- **Sections:** Each should earn its place. Cut sections that don't add value.
- **Ending:** Land on the core idea, not a call to action

## Language

| Avoid | Use instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Re-litigated, revisited | Came back up, had to re-explain |
| Context-setting, onboarding | Catching up, explaining |
| This isn't necessarily bad | (just cut it) |
| Might, could, probably (hedging) | Be direct or acknowledge uncertainty once |
| "In this post I will..." | Just start |
| Storytelling hooks ("Three months ago...") | State the insight or payoff first |

## Anti-patterns

- **AI-generated tells:** Excessive hedging, connector phrases ("This is what X enables"), promotional tone
- **Stating the obvious:** Don't explain things the reader already knows
- **Generic examples:** Use real (possibly unnamed) experience, not hypotheticals
- **Tech futurism without insight:** If you haven't built it or experienced it, don't speculate
- **Redundant sentences:** Say it once, say it well

## Questions to ask

1. **Do I have unique insight here?** If not, don't publish.
2. **Would I read this?** Cut anything that feels like filler.
3. **Is this authentic?** Does it sound like me or like AI trying to sound engaging?
4. **What's the one thing?** Each post should have one clear takeaway.

## Length

Shorter is better. A tight 400-word post beats a padded 800-word post. If a section doesn't add value, cut it.
