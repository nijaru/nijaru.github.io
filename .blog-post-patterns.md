# Blog Post Patterns - What Makes Successful HN Posts

## Key Patterns from Analysis

### Length
- **Sweet spot**: 500-650 words for focused posts
- **Upper limit**: 2000 words for deeper dives
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences) create better rhythm

### Structure
1. **Hook**: Bold opening statement or question
2. **Personal connection**: "I use X daily..."
3. **Core thesis**: One focused idea, not multiple
4. **Concrete examples**: Specific, relatable scenarios
5. **Contrarian angle**: Challenge conventional thinking
6. **Call to action**: What should readers do/think differently

### Writing Style
- **Conversational** but not casual
- **Declarative** statements over hedging
- **Rhetorical questions** to engage readers
- **Avoid defensive language** (don't say what it's NOT)
- **Personal anecdotes** ground abstract concepts

### Successful Examples

**"Fast" by Catherine Jue**
- Single word title
- Bold assertions: "Fast software has nowhere to hide"
- Ultra-short paragraphs
- Specific examples (spreadsheets, CAD)
- 600 words

**"Slow" by Michael**
- Rhetorical questions throughout
- Personal experience with long projects
- Challenges Silicon Valley's speed obsession
- 650 words

**"LLM Inevitabilism" by Tom Renner**
- Opens with personal anecdote
- Introduces academic concept
- Quotes tech leaders as evidence
- ~480 words

### What Doesn't Work
- Multiple unrelated themes
- Corporate/marketing language
- Defensive explanations
- Abstract without concrete examples
- Trying to cover everything

### The Formula
1. One bold idea
2. Personal stake in it
3. Universal examples
4. Challenge status quo
5. Clear next step
